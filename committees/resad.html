  <h2>Residential Advocacy Committee</h2>
  <h3>What do we do?</h3>
  <p>The Advocacy Committee discusses NYU policy in regards to departments relating to Residential Life such as: Housing, Student Affairs, Dining, Sustainability, Public Safety, ITS (Information and Technology Services), Transportation, and any other relevant policies affecting the residential experience. The committee, led by the two Vice Presidents of Residential Advocacy, also plans and prepares for the semesterly Town Hall event.  We also address any issues that arise around campus, by holding meetings with administrators on campus when necessary to discuss student interests.</p>
  <h3>Our Impact</h3>
  <p>The committee addresses issues that Hall Council members, committee members and students alike bring up and discuss. The Residential Advocacy committee takes these voiced concerns and does their best to improve or change the existing policy, to adapt to the ever changing lifestyle of NYU students. The committee works closely with NYU Administrators to know the most up to date policies to best inform the NYU community of the policies around campus to make life at NYU as enjoyable as possible. The purpose of the committee is to inform students of what is happening around campus and to change these policies to better serve the studentâ€™s interests.  With this committee, students have the chance to make a difference on campus by changing policy and by interacting with NYU administration.</p>
