  <h2>Conference Delegation</h2>
  <h3>What do we do?</h3>
    <p>NYU is part of an organization called the North American Federation of College and University Residence Halls (NACURH), within which they are a part of the NorthEast region (NEACURH). The conference delegation attends three conferences a year: NEACURH Regionals, Minis No-Frills, and NACURH Nationals. They present programs, create and perform roll calls, showcase banners, make new friends, and show off their NYU spirit!</p>
  <h3>Our Impact</h3>
    <p>Attending conference is an incredible experience for every member of the delegation. Not only do we get to create memories that can only be found at conference, but we also continue to impact NACURH by being a school with voting rights. By attending the three conferences throughout the year, we get to continuously make a change in NACURH. For residential life, the changes we make have the potential to affect NYU.</p>
  <h3>Landmarks</h3>
    <p>The Residential Advocacy Committee has made impacts across campus through policy changes and administrative action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changed Housing Lottery policy - late 1990’s/early 2000’s (exact date TBD)</li>
      <li>Changed entrance policy to scanning ID’s to enter buildings - early 2000’s (exact year TBD) </li>
      <li>Changed guest policy from 3 nights to 4 nights - 2013 (effective Fall 2014)</li>
      <li>Initialized printing program in Residence Halls - 2014 (still in progress)</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>By joining this committee, students will benefit by developing professional communications skills  administrators and students, as well as planning events like our Town Hall or other educational programs dealing with NYU policy changes. You would also benefit from learning how policy is made/changed at NYU and be recognized by administration through working with them, and from your peers in bettering their experience at NYU. </p>
