<h2>UltraViolet Live</h2>
<p id="one-liner"><b>
Ultra Violet Live (UVL) is a New York University tradition showcasing the best of NYU student talent. Preliminary rounds are hosted across the university’s campuses in New York, Shanghai, and Abu Dhabi. The best 15 acts compete live at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts.</b>
</p>
<p>Ultra Violet Live (UVL), conceptualized by Tom Eliot in [YEAR] , is a school-wide talent competition for NYU students. In 2012, participation was expanded to the NYU Poly campus in Brooklyn and commuters, in 2013, UVL began to include NYU Abu Dhabi students, and in 2014, it was broadened to include staff as well as NYU Shanghai students, and the NYU UVL for Alumni was launched. Ultra Violet Live is part of Violet 100, the NYU Spirit Week. Individual halls hold preliminary competitions, and from the first place winners, 15 compete at the university level. </p>
<p>At Ultra Violet Live there is a DJ that gets the crowd pumped before performers come on stage. There is a wide variety of talents displayed at UVL. Performances include (but are not limited to) singers, dancers, comedians, beat boxers, and poets. IRHC brings in celebrity judges like people who work or perform on Broadway as well as 2005’s second place winner, Lady Gaga’s mother. Besides the winner chosen by the panel of judges, students can vote on their phone to give one contestant the fan favorite award. UVL won the NACURH (National Association of College and University Residence Halls) Program of the Year award in 2007.
