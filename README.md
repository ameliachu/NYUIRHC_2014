2014 Resign Project

The NYU Inter-Residence Hall Council(IRHC) is the umbrella organization of residence hall councils at New York University. The NYU IRHC website, unveiled in 2005, has been the main portal of communication between the IRHC and the NYU community at-large. Unfortunately, much of the infrastructure and front-end design has not been updated since. The 2014 Redesign Project will bring the NYU IRHC website up to current design and ... standards.
